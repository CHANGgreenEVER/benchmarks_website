        <h1>Automated Labeling of Lane Markers</h1>
      </header>



{% load static %}
<p>The unsupervised LLAMAS (Labeled LAne Markers) dataset was generated automatically using map projections and reprojection optimizations.
In the following, we are going to visualize the complete process of generating the lane marker labels step by step.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_color_rect.jpg" %}" alt="Highwa camera image" />
</div>
<p>As a first step, we need an automated vehicle with extrinsically and intrinsically calibrated camera sensor(s). Recording camera images usually is fairly straightforward.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/map_crop.jpg" %}" alt="Map visualization" />
</div>
<p>We also need a high definition map of lane markers that we can localize against.
Such a map can be generated with a few drives over the same area. 
One important principle is that we only need to detect lane markers very close to our vehicle since we are going to closely pass all of them over time.
At short distances, lane markers are mostly very easy to detect which we did with a lidar sensor, but that is not a necessity.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_segmentation_bad.jpg" %}" alt="Image with initial lane marker projection" />
</div>
<p>After localizing against the map, we can project the mapped markers into the image for arbitrary distances. Unfortunately, this projection is not going to be completely accurate because of inaccurate localization, calibration offsets, a moving suspension, and much more.
Even small rotational offsets linearly increase with distance.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_tophat_9_9.jpg" %}" alt="Image after top hat filter" />
</div>
<p>Without labels, we can already (poorly) detect lane markers using very straightforward methods such as edge detectors or the output from an applied top hat filter based on a 9x9 kernel as displayed above.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_tophat_thresh_cut.png" %}" alt="Camera image after top hat filter and thresholding" />
</div>
<p>By thresholding the filter output and removing the upper parts of the image, we can already get a very simple lane marker estimate with only three lines of code.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_tophat_thresh_cut_and_bad.png" %}" alt="Detections and initial lane marker projection" />
</div>
<p>In this view, especially on the right, we can see an offset between detected (white) and projected markers (red) already.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_tophat_thresh_cut_good_and_bad.png" %}" alt="Detections with corrected lane marker projection" />
</div>
<p>We can now optimize the marker projection from the map into the image to better fit the detected markers. The correct markers are displayed in green and can already be used as labels.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_inference.png" %}" alt="Sample lane marker segmentation inference" />
</div>
<p>After annotating a few thousand images like that, we can train an actual detector on those initially generated labels. The output of such a trained model is displayed above.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_tophat_thresh_cut_good_and_bad_inference.png" %}" alt="Map projection and lane marker detection" />
</div>
<p>These better detections (white) allow for a more accurate projection (green) of markers from the map into the image. In red, we show the initial projection (red) based on calibration and localization only.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="{% static "llamas/images/pipeline/1419287247_0942030000_segmentation_correct.jpg" %}" alt="Camera image of freeway driving with annotated lane markers" />
</div>
<p>This image shows the corrected projection with map information such as individual lane markers and lane associations in the original image. There still are offsets because of occluded markers, inaccurate detections, and flaws in the auto generated map (for example, see the red marker on the left), but labeling up to the accuracy provided by this approach already is extremely time consuming and tricky.
</p>
